# Group 2 Assignment Part 2
 
-For this part of the assignment, our group came together and finished it in a span of a few hours. For the most part, we followed all of the directions presented to us in Dr. Jafarian's presentations. Artsiom set up the Github repo with everyone in the group, borrowed the code from the VueJS classwork, and started working on it. Artsiom took parts 1 and 2 upon himself, Dax did parts 2 and 3, and Micah chose to do all the Vue.js research needed for us to complete this assignment. Dax worked on the API calls such as subtitles, rating counts, page counts, and descriptions of each of the books.
-We wanted to make our website as symmetrical as we could, so therefore, we chose to add a temporary thumbnail to all of the books from the google API that do not have a thumbnail themselves. Artsiom used Adobe Photoshop to scale down the picture and add a text on it which said "no thumbnail," so no one would not think that it was a thumbnail of the book.  By adding a temporary thumbnail, the website started to look much nicer and much more organized.
